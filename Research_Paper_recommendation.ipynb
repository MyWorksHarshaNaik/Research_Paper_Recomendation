The foundation of GNNs is the message passing\\nprocedure, which propagates the information in a node to its neighbors. Since\\nthis procedure proceeds one step per layer, the range of the information\\npropagation among nodes is small in the lower layers, and it expands toward the\\nhigher layers. Therefore, a GNN model has to be deep enough to capture global\\nstructural information in a graph.

Results of our experiments show that the MLAP architecture\\nimproves the graph classification performance compared to the baseline\\narchitectures.

However, the lack of transparency and\\naccountability of most accurate models often hinders their safe use. Thus,\\nthere is a clear need for developing explainable artificial intelligence\\nmechanisms.

However, the lack of transparency and\\naccountability of most accurate models often hinders their safe use. Thus,\\nthere is a clear need for developing explainable artificial intelligence\\nmechanisms. There exist model-agnostic methods that summarize feature\\ncontributions, but their interpretability is limited to predictions made by\\nblack-box models. An open challenge is to develop models that have intrinsic\\ninterpretability and produce their own explanations, even for classes of models\\nthat are traditionally considered black boxes like (recurrent) neural networks.\\nIn this paper, we propose a Long-Term Cognitive Network for interpretable\\npattern classification of structured data. Our method brings its own mechanism\\nfor providing explanations by quantifying the relevance of each feature in the\\ndecision process. For supporting the interpretability without affecting the\\nperformance, the model incorporates more flexibility through a quasi-nonlinear\\nreasoning rule that allows controlling nonlinearity. Besides, we propose a\\nrecurrence-aware decision model that evades the issues posed by unique fixed\\npoints while introducing a deterministic learning method to compute the tunable\\nparameters. The simulations show that our interpretable model obtains\\ncompetitive results when compared to the state-of-the-art white and black-box\\nmodels.  "

      " Abstract : b'Compressing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has received ever-increasing\\nresearch focus. However, most existing CNN compression methods do not interpret\\ntheir inherent structures to distinguish the implicit redundancy. In this\\npaper, we investigate the problem of CNN compression from a novel interpretable\\nperspective. The relationship between the input feature maps and 2D kernels is\\nrevealed in a theoretical framework, based on which a kernel sparsity and\\nentropy (KSE) indicator is proposed to quantitate the feature map importance in\\na feature-agnostic manner to guide model compression. Kernel clustering is\\nfurther conducted based on the KSE indicator to accomplish high-precision CNN\\ncompression. KSE is capable of simultaneously compressing each layer in an\\nefficient way, which is significantly faster compared to previous data-driven\\nfeature map pruning methods. We comprehensively evaluate the compression and\\nspeedup of the proposed method on CIFAR-10, SVHN and ImageNet 2012. Our method\\ndemonstrates superior performance gains over previous ones. In particular, it\\nachieves 4.7 \\\\times FLOPs reduction and 2.9 \\\\times compression on ResNet-50\\nwith only a Top-5 accuracy drop of 0.35% on ImageNet 2012, which significantly\\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods.'\n",

We\\ncan use this network to perform the same inference tasks as we would in an\\nundirected graphical model with hidden variables, without having to deal with\\nthe intractable partition function. The results can be mapped to the learning\\nof an actual undirected model, which is a notoriously hard problem. Our network\\nalso marginalizes nuisance variables as required.

Without manual\\ntuning, nnU-Net surpasses most specialised deep learning pipelines in 19 public\\ninternational competitions and sets a new state of the art in the majority of\\nthe 49 tasks. The results demonstrate a vast hidden potential in the systematic\\nadaptation of deep learning methods to different datasets. We make nnU-Net\\npublicly available as an open-source tool that can effectively be used\\nout-of-the-box, rendering state of the art segmentation accessible to\\nnon-experts and catalyzing scientific progress as a framework for automated\\nmethod design.'\n",

      " Abstract : b'Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units have the ability to memorise and use\\nlong-term dependencies between inputs to generate predictions on time series\\ndata. We introduce the concept of modifying the cell state (memory) of LSTMs\\nusing rotation matrices parametrised by a new set of trainable weights. This\\naddition shows significant increases of performance on some of the tasks from\\nthe bAbI dataset.'\n",

    "# Example usage\n",
    "new_abstract = \"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used to learn vector\\nrepresentation of graph-structured data and achieved better task performance\\nthan conventional methods. The foundation of GNNs is the message passing\\nprocedure, which propagates the information in a node to its neighbors. Since\\nthis procedure proceeds one step per layer, the range of the information\\npropagation among nodes is small in the lower layers, and it expands toward the\\nhigher layers. Therefore, a GNN model has to be deep enough to capture global\\nstructural information in a graph. On the other hand, it is known that deep GNN\\nmodels suffer from performance degradation because they lose nodes' local\\ninformation, which would be essential for good model performance, through many\\nmessage passing steps. In this study, we propose multi-level attention pooling\\n(MLAP) for graph-level classification tasks, which can adapt to both local and\\nglobal structural information in a graph. It has an attention pooling layer for\\neach message passing step and computes the final graph representation by\\nunifying the layer-wise graph representations. The MLAP architecture allows\\nmodels to utilize the structural information of graphs with multiple levels of\\nlocalities because it preserves layer-wise information before losing them due\\nto oversmoothing. Results of our experiments show that the MLAP architecture\\nimproves the graph classification performance compared to the baseline\\narchitectures. In addition, analyses on the layer-wise graph representations\\nsuggest that aggregating information from multiple levels of localities indeed\\nhas the potential to improve the discriminability of learned graph\\nrepresentations.\"\n",

    "new_abstract = 'Deep networks and decision forests (such as random forests and gradient\\nboosted trees) are the leading machine learning methods for structured and\\ntabular data, respectively. Many papers have empirically compared large numbers\\nof classifiers on one or two different domains (e.g., on 100 different tabular\\ndata settings). However, a careful conceptual and empirical comparison of these\\ntwo strategies using the most contemporary best practices has yet to be\\nperformed. Conceptually, we illustrate that both can be profitably viewed as\\n\"partition and vote\" schemes. Specifically, the representation space that they\\nboth learn is a partitioning of feature space into a union of convex polytopes.\\nFor inference, each decides on the basis of votes from the activated nodes.\\nThis formulation allows for a unified basic understanding of the relationship\\nbetween these methods. Empirically, we compare these two strategies on hundreds\\nof tabular data settings, as well as several vision and auditory settings. Our\\nfocus is on datasets with at most 10,000 samples, which represent a large\\nfraction of scientific and biomedical datasets. In general, we found forests to\\nexcel at tabular and structured data (vision and audition) with small sample\\nsizes, whereas deep nets performed better on structured data with larger sample\\nsizes. This suggests that further gains in both scenarios may be realized via\\nfurther combining aspects of forests and networks. We will continue revising\\nthis technical report in the coming months with updated results.'\n",
